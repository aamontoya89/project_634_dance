# project_634_dance

this repository holds the files for the dance piece 6:34

concept, choreography and performance: donald shorter
programming and visuals: aar√≥n montoya-moraga + yuli cai
music: "antennae", timothy andres


possible things:
biometric sensors on dancer
kinect

starts in complete blackness and music starts to play
not just black and white, we can use colors for projection

dance projectors where instead of lighting,
we will use projectors for interactive video

todo:
someone for documentation, video and sound


intro:
the first cue is music
lights fade down
something liquid flowing down from upstage right
to downstage right
like a pool of lights
oily thingy pouring down and it makes a separation
and donald stands there, it parts and donald comes in
directions taken from perspective of performer
and then the flow stops being input and the remaining oil
goes away, continues flowing

next thing:
donald walks in geometrical patterns, he goes up, goes down on a diagonal and then goes up again straight, and then accross the stage.

next thing:
donald stares into a window and goes to an otherwordly world

think of geometrical, linear and non linear thingies
