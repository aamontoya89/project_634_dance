# project_six_minutes_dance

music is Timothy Andres- Antennae

with donald

dance projectors where instead of lighting,
we will use projectors for interactive video

dance is about investigating setting and space

if you change configuration in space, the dance changes
the mood of the dance changes

biometric sensors on dancer
kinect

piece starts with something simple
ideas progress and escalates in intensity

starts in complete blackness and music starts to play
donalds want to keep the music
can you send that to me please?

not just black and white, we can use colors for projection

we can also integrate yulis 3d work

donald is thinking about just floor projection, but we can include the psyche (the background screen).

the deadline for this show is early november

what about grants?
interdepartmental grants

roles:
donald: choreographer, dancer
aaron: interactive programming, technical director
yuli: let's talk with her

intro:
the first cue is music
lights fade down
something liquid flowing down from upstage right
to downstage right
like a pool of lights
oily thingy pouring down and it makes a separation
and donald stands there, it parts and donald comes in
directions taken from perspective of performer
and then the flow stops being input and the remaining oil
goes away, continues flowing

next thing:
donald walks in geometrical patterns, he goes up, goes down on a diagonal and then goes up again straight, and then accross the stage.

next thing:
donald stares into a window and goes to an otherwordly world

think of geometrical, linear and non linear thingies

todo:
* start sketching the intro, one minute
* we need someone for documentation, video and sound
* research the available projectors onsite and at nyu itp
* take measurements onsite
* go with yuli to test projectors when she gets back
