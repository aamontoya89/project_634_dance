# project_six_minutes_dance

with donald

dance projectors where instead of lighting,
we will use projectors for interactive video

dance is about investigating setting and space

if you change configuration in space, the dance changes
the mood of the dance changes

biometric sensors on dancer
kinect

piece starts with something simple
ideas progress and escalates in intensity

starts in complete blackness and music starts to play
donalds want to keep the music
can you send that to me please?

not just black and white, we can use colors for projection

we can also integrate yulis 3d work

donald is thinking about just floor projection, but we can include the psyche (the background screen).
