## sections:

intro:

the first cue is music

lights fade down

something liquid flowing down from upstage right

to downstage right

like a pool of lights

oily thingy pouring down and it makes a separation

and donald stands there, it parts and donald comes in

directions taken from perspective of performer

and then the flow stops being input and the remaining oil

goes away, continues flowing

next thing:

donald walks in geometrical patterns, he goes up, goes down on a diagonal and

then goes up again straight, and then accross the stage.

next thing:

donald stares into a window and goes to an otherwordly world

think of geometrical, linear and non linear thingies
