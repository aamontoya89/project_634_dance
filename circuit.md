# our experience working on interactive programming for dance
by yuli cai and aar√≥n montoya-moraga

##origins

we took a class on our first year called choreographic interventions, taught
by mimi yin. it was very cool, we had classes at the tisch dance department
on second avenue, and it was half itp students and half grad students of dance.

for us as itp people, it was a good introduction to notions of choreography and space and movement, while for the dancers they had a crash course on programming on processing, variables, loops, ifs. in each session we would team up and do exercises on both fields and collaborate and have fun.

## puppet project

for our final project for that class, we teamed with choreographer/dancer donald c. shorter jr, to create an interactive audiovisual experience. we worked with processing running on windows machines, in order to use the skeleton tracking data from the kinect 2. we used the oscp5 library to transmit to three different macbooks on stage, two for visuals and one for manipulating audio in realtime.

## the future




What is was like to show it at Maker Faire and/or all the other events you've showed it at. Or simple what it's been like to make a project and hang out with it for so long. Or just make a Pcomp project or... anything you'd like to share about it.

The Circuit still needs submissions for its second issue!

Please send us some content ASAP!! Or if you even just have an idea for content, let us know!! Any member of the Circuit team is fine or thecircuit.itp@gmail.com!
